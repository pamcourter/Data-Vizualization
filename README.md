# Data Vizualization collection
I'm starting to get into data analytics with vizualizations. Here I will show my most recent or best vizualizations in excel, power BI and Tableau. 



### Projects 
- My first excel dashboard based on Kaggle OnlineRetail.csv. Here I found that Most sales occur on Tuesday and Thursday with a slight drop on Wednesdays. I also did a histogram to reveal that most orders were in the $200-$450 range with a small spike in large orders over $1000. My actionable recommendation would be sending out a special 10% off up to $45 to target customers in this range.  -[Revenue Sales Dashboards](./Revenue_sales_dashboard.png/)
